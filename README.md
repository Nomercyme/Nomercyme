# Hi, I'm Abel! üëã

## üåü About me

I'm passionate about how AI and machine learning can transform industries and society positively. I am eager to contribute to projects that aim for a positive societal impact. I am currently focusing on energy markets and enabling a sustainable grid. 

## üéì Education

- **MSc in Business Engineering (Data Science)** - Catholic University of Leuven - Leuven, Belgium (09/2022 ‚Äì 06/2024)
- **BSc in Business Engineering (Finance)** - Catholic University of Leuven - Leuven, Belgium (09/2019 ‚Äì 07/2022)

## üèÜ Achievements / Projects

- **Energy Modelling Competition by LCP Delta**
  - Secured first place in a competition focused on BESS (Battery Energy Storage Systems) DFR (Dynamic Frequency Regulation) price forecasting using ML / DL techniques.
  - Goal was to forecast prices of UK's dynamic frequency regulation markets, one of the National Energy System Operator (NESO) ancillary markets, designed to maintain grid frequency within the range of 50Hz to ensure grid stability and prevent equipment failure
  - Scientific article on my winning solution: [Energy Modelling Competition by LCP Delta](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dEi0iejKhPlqIWViAowEcq1zNGuvl3nT/view?usp=sharing)
 
- **MS Thesis: Deep Learning and Electricity Price Forecasting on the Belgian Day-Ahead Market**
  - Conducted research on deep learning (DL / LSTM) and traditional statistical techniques (LEAR) for electricity spot price forecasting.
  - Achieved a grade of 17/20, demonstrating strong analytical and research capabilities and received PhD offer after.
  - Published small article in Dutch: [Deep Learning and Electricity Price Forecasting on the Belgian Day-Ahead Market](https://scriptiebank.be/scriptie/2024/deep-learning-and-electricity-price-forecasting-belgian-day-ahead-market-using)

- **PV Project**
  - One and a half year part-time research project at research group [ELECTA](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/electa), an electrical engineering research group focussed on smart grids.
  - Proposed a novel approach using YOLOv8-seg for precise (achieved 85% mAP50) rooftop PV segmentation in Utrecht, Netherlands.
  - Analyzed high-resolution aerial imagery and enhanced model robustness with a sanity check against ground truth data.
  - Implemented a unique hyperparameter tuning strategy to optimize the confidence threshold.
  - Article submitted to ACM e-Energy 2025: [Rooftop Solar PV Segmentation Using High-Resolution Multi-Year Aerial Imagery and Capacity Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kzEIUPSaC-dML64cAvzkYxv5OfQOXvVA/view?usp=sharing)
